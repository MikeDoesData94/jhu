This application first explores the Iris dataset visually, 
before removing outliers and performing feature ranking with
the Bhattacharyya distance equation.

All helper functions for the driver class `iris.py` are located
in `util.py`. Analysis document is under `docs` folder.

#### Directory Structure

	iris.py  
	util.py   
	SciottoPA1.pdf  
	/output  
		output.txt  
	README.md

#### Input

The driver program, `iris.py`, takes input from the `sklearn.datasets` module
and loads the Iris dataset using `load_iris()` function.

#### Output

All generated output will be located in the `output` folder.

#### Execution

`python iris.py`

Output will be located in the `output` folder.
